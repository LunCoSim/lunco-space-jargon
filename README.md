## TRL (Technological Readiness Levels)
- **TRL 1:** Basic principles observed and reported. This is the lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development (R&D). 
- **TRL 2:** Technology concept and/or application formulated. Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. Applications are speculative, and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions.
- **TRL 3:** Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept. Active R&D is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology.
- **TRL 4:** Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment. Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together. This is relatively "low fidelity" compared with the eventual system.
- **TRL 5:** Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment. The basic technological components are integrated so they can be tested in a simulated environment.
- **TRL 6:** System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Prototype is tested in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment.
- **TRL 7:** System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. Prototype near or at planned operational system. This might mean testing a prototype in space or in a space-like environment.
- **TRL 8:** Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration. The technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development.
- **TRL 9:** Actual system proven through successful mission operations. The technology is in its final form and operated under the full range of operating conditions. This is the highest level of readiness where the actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions has been fully demonstrated.
